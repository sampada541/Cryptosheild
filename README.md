# Cryptosheild
ABSTRACT
A cutting-edge web-based encryption solution called Cryptoshield offers strong protection for
sensitive data sent over the internet. Cryptoshield uses cutting-edge encryption methods like
AES-256 and SHA256 to guarantee the confidentiality and integrity of data while it is being
sent. It is a crucial tool for safeguarding sensitive data in the modern digital era due to its user-
friendly interface and secure data transmission features. Cryptoshield is a charming solution
for protecting data against unauthorised access and online dangers thanks to collaborative
development activities, thorough testing, and future improvements.
To get the best performance and reliability possible, Cryptoshield underwent thorough code
reviews and collaborative development. The effective deployment of Cryptoshield is the result
of the team's competence in encryption techniques and safe data processing.
The project anticipates exciting advancements like multifactor authentication, file encryption
capabilities, and mobile application development in the future. These improvements should
strengthen Cryptoshield's ability to protect data from new online dangers, reaffirming its status
as a cutting-edge web-based encryption solution.
1. INTRODUCTION
Data security is a crucial component of every web-based application in this digital age.
With its complete approach to safe online encryption, Cryptoshield promises to protect the
confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data, including passwords, credit card numbers,
and other personal information. The project focuses on using cutting-edge encryption
methods and following security best practises to protect data while it is being sent.
1.1. PROBLEM STATEMENT
The protection of sensitive data is a serious problem in today's digital environment. The
requirement to safeguard consumers' credit card and password information from
unauthorised access is underscored by the rising frequency of data breaches and cyber
threats. By offering a safe, dependable, and easy-to-use solution for encrypting and
decrypting sensitive data, the project seeks to address this important issue.
1.2. OBJECTIVE
The following are the main goals of the CRYPTOSHIELD project:
1. Use AES-256-CBC encryption to transmit data securely.
2. To protect data integrity, hash your data using the SHA256 method.
3. Create a user-friendly web-based encryption and decryption interface.
4. Use a MySQL database to safely store encrypted data.
1.3. TECHNOLOGIES USED
The project utilizes the following technologies:
1. Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
2. Backend: PHP
3. Database: MySQL
4. Encryption Algorithm: AES-256-CBC
5. Hashing Algorithm: SHA256
6. Encryption Functions: openssl_encrypt & openssl_decrypt
7. Encoding: Base64
2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
2.1. OVERVIEW
The client-server architecture used by the CRYPTOSHIELD system is used. Through
their web browsers, users communicate with the frontend, which sends queries to the
PHP-based backend server. These requests are processed by the backend, which also
interacts with the MySQL database for secure data storage and uses AES-256-CBC
and SHA256 encryption and decryption algorithms, respectively.
2.2. COMPONENTS
The system consists of the following components:
1. Frontend: The user interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for interacting
with the system.
2. Backend: PHP scripts that handle encryption, decryption, and database interactions.
3. Database: MySQL database to securely store encrypted data.
2.3. DATA FLOW
The CRYPTOSHIELD system's data flow looks like this:
1. The front-end interface is where users enter data.
2. Using HTTP requests, the frontend transmits the data to the backend server.
3. The data is encrypted using AES-256-CBC by the backend, and a SHA256 hash is
produced to ensure data integrity.
4. The hash and encrypted data are safely stored together in the MySQL database.
5. The backend obtains the encrypted data from the database and uses the AES-256-CBC
technique to decode it when decryption is necessary.
3. FEATURES
3.1. AES-256-CBC Encryption
The system uses the well-known and reliable AES-256-CBC encryption technique to
protect data while it is being TRANSMITTED.
3.2. SHA256 Hash
Data integrity verification using SHA256 is used to create a hash that ensures the
data is unaltered while in transit.
3.3. Web-based Interface
Users may simply encrypt and decrypt their data using the system's user-friendly
web-based interface.
3.4. Secure Data Storage
A MySQL database stores encrypted data, adding another level of protection to
safeguard critical data.
4. IMPLEMENTATION
4.1. Encryption Module
The encryption module is implemented in PHP and uses the AES-256-CBC
encryption algorithm to encrypt user data securely.
4.2. Decryption Module
The decryption module, also written in PHP, allows users to decrypt their encrypted
data using the AES-256-CBC decryption method.
4.3. User Interface
The frontend is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-
friendly interface for data encryption and decryption.
4.4. Database Management
The system interacts with the MySQL database for storing and retrieving encrypted
data securely
